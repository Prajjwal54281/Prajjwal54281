## 👋 Hey! Nice to see you.

Welcome to my GitHub 👨‍💻

I’m **Prajjwal Mishra**, a **Software Engineer** specializing in  
**Generative AI, Distributed Systems, Cloud, and Full-Stack Engineering**.

I have **4+ years of experience** building **production-grade AI systems and cloud-scale distributed platforms**, taking products from early research to reliable, real-world deployment.

🎓 **M.S. in Computer Science & Engineering (AI/ML)**  
📍 United States  
📩 Open to **Software Engineer, Backend Engineer, and Applied AI roles**

## 🧠 What I Do

### 🤖 Software Engineer (AI / Research)
I design and deploy **multimodal AI systems** with real-world impact, including platforms for **early detection of pediatric speech disorders**.

My work includes:
- Training **PyTorch-based deep learning models**
- Building **reproducible evaluation pipelines**
- Deploying **real-time inference systems** in production environments

---

### ⚙️ Backend & Cloud Engineering (2.5+ years)
Previously, I built and scaled **Java / Spring Boot microservices**,  
**Kafka-based streaming pipelines (100K+ events/sec)**, and **cloud-native systems on AWS**.

Highlights:
- Optimized latency-critical APIs
- Built HIPAA-compliant, large-scale platforms
- Designed event-driven and microservice architectures
- Improved system scalability and reliability in production

---

### 🧩 Full-Stack Ownership
Alongside AI and backend work, I build **end-to-end products** using  
**React, Angular, and Next.js**, backed by robust APIs and scalable databases.

I enjoy owning problems holistically — from **model design and infrastructure** to **polished user-facing features**.
